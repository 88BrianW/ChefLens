# ChefLens

Our team is designing an app called ChefLens for the 2023-2024 year. This helpful tool
utilizes AI detection algorithms in photos to provide recipes and nutritional values based
on your available ingredients.


This app provides a unique value to users incomparable to other apps because the
service will be completely free to use, and no features will be locked behind paywalls.
Funding for the project will likely come from advertisements or sponsorships from
companies. Other nutrition tracking apps such as Cronometer have a subscription
service that gives the user simplified diet tracking. We will provide all of our services for
free, which makes the app much more accessible for younger people, as well as
families who may not be financially stable. Easy free-to-use access for teens promotes
early healthy eating and dieting, which can contribute to their well-being down the road.
Although there may be other apps that are also completely free, their apps are likely
made with very poor UI or programming, which may give off the impression to users that
the app is not trustworthy. They will not provide those apps with their private dietary
information. We will do better in this aspect by providing our users with an easy-to-use
UI and a streamlined navigational experience. Our app also utilizes AI, which will also
be free to use for the user. Many AI apps online may have their most sophisticated and
trained AI behind paywalls, which we will not have. The user will immediately have
access to our most accurate AI model to provide them with the most specific and helpful
results for their dieting and meal preparation needs.
